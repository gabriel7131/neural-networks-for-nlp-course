    "In the previous lesson we took a dive on Natural Language Processing using neural networks. Using sentiment analysis as our first task to work with, we tried several models to tackle it as much as we could. We did so incrementally, trying to simplify the problem as much as possible to ensure that it would fit in the neural networks we have seen so far. **This approach of coming up with the simplest possible solution is usually a good idea, because complicated models tend to be harder to develop and understand, as well as more expensive to train.** However, we finished the lesson with the clear understanding that some problems might need more involved machinery.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also left four exercises to the reader, which you hopefully have put some time into. Since they were mostly exploratory in nature, we will not solve them here. However, we will sketch what you might have gotten from them so we can keep going:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On the impact of dataset size, **the only clear-cut answer is that we really need training data!** After trying a few partition sizes for training and evaluating, you might have noticed that the learned weights were a lot noisier for smaller training sizes. This is normal: **the fewer training examples, the least likely it is that we will learn a proper representation.** Our dataset was very small, which accentuates this problem.\n",
    "2. Using a `Bag of Words` model that also encodes the frequency of words in a document might have some small effect, but for our dataset it did not matter much. **It is a good idea to revisit this approach for some of the more involved problems we will see now.**\n",
    "3. Because of the small dataset, **we need a high ratio of negative samples for the embeddings to make sense.** Lower ratios meant less powerful embeddings. On the other hand, higher ratios also mean more samples, and that has a direct impact on training speed!\n",
    "4. Finally, alternative words embeddings can better capture syntactic over semantic characteristics or vice-versa. As such, **they can outperform one another depending on the problem we are trying to solve!**\n",

By representing using embedding vectors and averaging the embeddings of all words in a document, we are introducing structural information from a large corpus into our reduced problem.

    "# Dealing with structure: Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense, we have hinted our intentions all the way through. After all, why should a neural network take up a whole document, image, song as input? **Doesn't it make more sense to have small networks that learn the relationships between the parts that make up the whole?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple idea is the fundamental leap with Convolutional Neural Networks (or CNNs for brevity). In short, what we try to learn are filters over an structured input. This structure can be plenty of things: a sequence of words, a matrix of colors, the frames of a video... The idea is that our neural network will learn to capture some property in the parts that form input. Then, we will aggregate and compress the representation to produce a higher understanding of what we are dealing with. **By stacking layers upon layers that encode and compress with this structure, we reach the point where we can easily classify it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "What we have presented is best understood with a couple of pictures. The terms we use to describe CNNs come from the field of computer vision, so we will first show an example of their application to image classification:\n",

    "<img src=\"images/ImageIntoCNN.png\" width=\"1000\" alt=\"A single diagram explaining how a convolutional neural network will turn a structured input into many unstructured vector inputs.\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "A convolutional neural network learns filters over small parts of the whole. In our picture example, this means little blocks of $3 \\times 3$ pixels. With these filters, we can aggregate the information from the concrete into the abstract: from lines we go into shapes, from shapes into textures, from textures we see materials and from materials we learn to classify concrete objects. **The networks that we use to process the groups of information at each level are the simplest amongst what we have seen**: single layer neural networks with a simple activation such as ReLU. The input for these little networks is the vector shown at the rightmost side of the image, which is itself the flattenned version of the third pixel patch on the top row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, we introduce additional operations in the middle to further simplify our problem. These operations add another degree of non-linearity over the structure our networks process without adding additional learnable parameters. An example of this is computing the average or maximum over chunks, which is called pooling. The combination of the convolutional layers, which learn filters, and the pooling layers, which aggregate over them, is applied repeatedly. **At some point, the output is reduced to a few features that, hopefully, capture the nature of our problem and can be flattened and passed to a vector-hungry neural network.**  The general principles of the underlying machinery remain the same. \n",

    "**Ideally, we would be looking at real world examples for everything‚Äîit so just happens that image classification problems tend to take a good amount of time to train!** In the case of text, we can just think of our embedded document matrix, the one that we discussed before for the ngram processing approach. **Instead of processing the ngrams that we have defined ourselves, the network will learn filters over windows of tokens.** The windows will be of a fixed size, but they will be able to learn the relationships between the embeddings in those windows‚Äî**and that includes unigrams, bigrams, and any sort of ngram up to the window length!**\n",

Even if the first layers only capture relationships over groups of 3 words, we can apply another set of filters on top! **This lets us capture relationships that are farther away, weighting each of the words appropriately.** As always, we prefer drawings over explanations, so let's just take a look at how this would look like:\n",

After stacking our bunch of convolutions, we build a final multi-class classifier. Remember that when we want to select a class out of many, we typically use a softmax output and categorical crossentropy as our loss function. **This way we build a model that predicts the individual probability of each class, in hopes that the highest probability will belong to the actual class!** \n",

Dropout is one but many regularization techniques to improve general performance. Here, regularization means exactly that: achieving more general models. **Regularization techniques are helpful because very often our neural networks have so many parameters that they will pay too much attention to the training examples and overfit on them.** This means that the model they implement is not very general, because it will not apply beyond the training set. Using Dropout solves this by randomly dropping units at training time. Here, dropping means that they will not learn and that, instead, they will just pass a constant signal (typically zero). **This allows the model to learn more robust representations, since there must be multiple avenues for a signal to really be taken into account!** Dropout is easy to understand visually:\n",

Furthermore, we have kept the embeddings to be trainable. **Our embeddings not being trainable means that they may not be shared with other tasks and that they just act as background information when we begin training.** Is this setup enough to capture the classification problem? How much performance are we actually getting out of retraining the embeddings? Should we use a higher or lower dropout rate? \n",

So far we have relied on accuracy, interpreted as counting the number of times we get a prediction correct out of all inputs we test. **However, this measure posses some problems: if our dataset is not balanced, a model that predicts just a single class might seem good enough!** Likewise, in a multiclass setting, we would want to have a breakdown of how well we are doing for each class‚Äîas we might underperform for some kinds of inputs, and we would want to improve on them!\n",

Finally, the F1 measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and can be understood as an aggregate metric to reduce both to a single value that can . **These metrics give us a per-class understanding of how well our model captures the class and how much it misses elements from it.** Let's compute them for our model:"

    "Thinking is good for figuring out limitations about our models, however. When we were using vanilla deep neural networks, our problem was that we could not capture the structure that an image or a document may have. **We solved this by introducing convolutional neural networks, which allow us to process the forming pieces of some continuous structure.** In that way, we can process chunks of pixels or groups of words... but is this enough?\n",

As we would be looking as windows of tokens, it really should not surprise us if a model said that the `new management` were the ones sitting!\n",

    "The problem with CNNs for text is that structure assumed is flat‚Äîwe take words and fundamentally compute a weighted sum... **However, it is clear that our understanding of a word depends on how the word appears in the sentence.** In a sense, we could talk about the `state` of a word‚Äîthe way in which it plays with the words that came before.

    "By the way we ended the last section, you should already guess what we are going for. Although vanilla and convolutional neural networks are very powerful, in a sense we are still missing some basic building block. **We are dealing with sentences or documents, which are ordered lists of words‚Äîand the order matters!** Ideally, we would want a model that understands that `blue` coming before `sky` is not the same as it appearing after `feeling`! **More generally, our ideal model would keep track of what it has seen so far, and this in turn would let it appropriately \"read\" what we are trying to say.**\n",
    "\n",
    "How could such a model be implemented? The models we have seen so far always take the data as it is, without any reference to their own output. However, when we are processing things that have an order, things that flow in some given direction, we need to be able to do that kind of remembering. This is what Recurrent Neural Networks do: keeping track of state. **Recurrent Neural Networks (or RNNs) extend the same plain old vanilla neural networks with input state vectors that represent our knowledge up to a point.** This is best seen visually:\n",

    "<img src=\"images/RecurrentNetwork.png\" width=\"1000\" alt=\"A side-by-side look at a traditional neural network and a recurrent neural network. The recurrent neural network can be seen as a vanilla neural network whose output is used as part of its input in successive states!\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram actually hides away a good chunk of complexity. **Although simple RNNs as such have been used, they typically have problems dealing with long sequences and can be generally hard to train.** This is because the propagation of the errors, due to the simple self-referential nature of the design, ends up either exploding (going to infinity) or vanishing (going to zero). Modern RNN architectures involve some other transformations on the input and state vectors to keep this from happening. Since we are focusing on using them, however, we just have to be happy that researchers have carried us to this point!\n",

    "So with this idea in mind, we must give recurrent networks a shot! **Because of how they are defined, they are very well suited to our problem: the input to a recurrent network will be a sequence of vectors.** As we have been doing up to this point, this means we can use a padded $(N \\times d)$ matrix of up to $N$ states with embedding word vectors of dimension $d$. Depending on whether our task is to talk about every state or about the whole document, we can then use the whole set of output states or just the last one.

    "Those results look quite promising! **Looking only at the recurrent part of the model, we are getting close to the performance of our convolutional classification model‚Äîwith 6 times less parameters!** Of course, you may have noticed that this network took longer to train. After all, we had to train for 25 epochs instead of the 10 epochs we needed for our Convolutional Network! This is because Recurrent Neural Networks perform their processing sequentially and have to learn to keep track of the state. **Their sequential nature means that they cannot be easily parallelized, which in turn has an obvious impact on performance.** Furthermore, managing the interaction between states is no easy task, with vanilla RNNs usually having poor short term memory. This means that longer sequences become hard to train on, since the network is not able to keep up with the information contained across the states.\n",
    "\n",
    "This last problem is the reason why we have used the LSTM, which stands for Long Short Term Memory. **LSTMs manage to process longer sequences by processing the inputs through a series of small networks, called gates, that let them keep and forget specific parts of the state, the input and the output.** There is no need to describe the details of the gating mechanism, but you may understand it as component-wise probabilities of keeping, forgetting or outputting each of the vector features. Another similarly designed and used network is the GRU, which stands for Gated Recurrent Unit. **The GRU simplifies the gating by merging some of these small networks together to further reduce the number of parameters.**\n",

    "In either case, it is a good idea to go over the idea of RNNs as an abstraction. **Recurrent nets go through a list of states sequentially, and they do so in one direction.** However, in some cases the relationships between words can be a hard to capture if we are reading sequentially. One trivial extension is to read in both directions: this is aptly named a *bidirectional* RNN. Bidirectional RNNs are often used in Natural Language problems because the relationships between words can happen in either direction:\n",

But before jumping onto those, we have to have one final discussion about recurrent neural networks: can RNNs be composed? Our diagrams and our code give us different responses. In our abstract examples, we are processing each input one at a time and outputting something. **The result, then, should always be a sequence with as many vectors as there were inputs in the original sequence. However, looking at our code, the RNN layer is just producing a final output vector.** What gives? Well, turns out both things make sense! Keras by default makes RNN layers return the last output they produced. However, we can make our RNNs return sequences very easily, by simply passing the `return_sequences=True` argument!

    "> Machine Learning models tend to have many possible options to control how the learning is performed and to adjust different settings of the underlying algorithms. These settings are called hyperparameters, and determine the actual parameters that the model learns ‚Äî hence the name. **In the case of neural networks, we can choose activation functions, layers to use, number of layers, units per layer, the interaction between successive layers as a whole... That is, we have a ton of hyperparameters!** When we are designing our model for a particular task, we obviously want to make sure that it is well suited for it, and the best way to do this is through experiment.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> One common way of finding reasonable parameters is called [Grid search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization#Grid_search). **Grid search is simple process: we perform an exhaustive search over some set parameters, and select the best with respect to some metric.** Consider the convolutional neural network architecture that we designed, and assume that our layers, number of units per layer and layer interactions are fixed. Try to find reasonable values for the dropout rate, whether or not to use pretrained embeddings and whether or not to retrain those embeddings. Specifically, your task is to evaluate the following set of hyperparameters:\n",
    "> > ```python\n",
    "> > dropout_rates = [0.0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5]\n",
    "> > glove_options = [True, False]\n",
    "> > retrain_options = [True, False]```\n",

    "> **To compare each of the models, you could either use the validation accuracy or the validation loss.** In the case of accuracy, we will chose the model reaching the highest value of all of them. On the contrary, in the case of our loss function, we will chose the model that reaches the lowest possible value. As a reminder, the loss function is the error function we minimize during learning, so lower is better.\n",
